PROJECT 3: CENSUS GAME APP

Our app - which uses APIs for Google Maps and the United States Census - will help users learn about population distrobution and density in the United States, then test them on their knowledge. A user will be able to...
	-Interact with a map of the United States to see population/demographic details for all 50 states, as well many of the cities, towns, villages, etc. within them. 
	-Save data on different cities, states, and regions to their personal collection for comparison and reference. 
	-Test their knowledge in a "game" mode, which will generate questions using internal logic. STRECTH GOAL: the test generation logic will include several difficult settings that will effect which specific cities, regions, etc. the user is tested on. 
		some sample question ideas: 
		-guessing the population of a given location from a moderately zoomed map view
		-guessing which of two locations has a larger population
		-guessing the desnity of a location with its population given
	-Save scores, winning streaks, etc. to their profile.
